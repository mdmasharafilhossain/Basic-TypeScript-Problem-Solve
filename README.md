## 5. What is type inference in TypeScript? Why is it helpful?

**Type Inference in TypeScript: Make code smarter and safer!**

Those who work with JavaScript are well aware that it is a dynamically typed language. This means that when declaring a variable in JavaScript, the type (like number, string) does not need to be specified. The type is determined at runtime by the JavaScript program.
Although the code can be written much faster, the possibility of bugs increases, and it takes a lot of time to find them.

The solution to this problem is TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript. TypeScript offers static typing, which means that type errors are caught at compile time. However, one of the great features of TypeScript is type inference.

**What is type inference ?**

In simple terms, type inference is the ability of the TypeScript compiler to automatically infer the type of a variable, function parameter, or function return type without explicitly stating the type. That is, when a value is assigned to a variable, TypeScript automatically determines the type of the variable based on that value.

**Why type inference is helpful?**

**1. Less code to write:** If you explicitly write each variable, function parameter, or return type separately, the code will become much longer and more complex. Type interface solves this problem.

**2. Improved constructability:** Sometimes it happens that the type is clearly understood, but if we declare the type again separately, that makes the code more complex. It is also difficult to understand. Type interface solves this problem and keeps the code clean.

**3. Fewer errors are caught:** Sometimes, we do not clearly understand what the type will be. In this case, the typescript compiler guesses the type and checks the type, and in this case, there are fewer errors.

**4. Flexible Adoption:**
Those who are new to typescript can slowly and accurately get used to typescript by using the type interface


In conclusion, type inference is what makes TypeScript a strong and easy-to-use language. It gives developers the security of type safety while still letting them write code that is as fast and flexible as JavaScript. You can make your code stronger, easier to maintain, and free of bugs with TypeScript.
